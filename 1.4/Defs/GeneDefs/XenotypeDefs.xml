		<description>Based on genetic data retrofitted from Gauranlen Inc.’s investment into dendrology following the Fall of Sorne, phytokins are plant-based humanoids with an emphasis on symmetry and symbiosis. Their ability to subsist only on sunlight and affinity with any and all plantlife make them especially suited to aiding newly established colonies or underperforming industrial farms.\n\nWhile used as an attempt to subvert certain subpopulations with plant-heavy diets to favor companies that employ them, phytokin xenogerms are usually only offered to loyal employees in order to reduce the chance of their asexual reproduction blossoming out of control and earning them a voice on human rights platforms. Their affinity with plantlife, along with the side effect of extremely high psychic sensitivity, mean that any phytokin xenohumans found on the Rim are always adapted to high-concept, dominant trees that are present on their residing planet.\n\nThis particular xenogerm has adapted itself to Polux trees, allowing it to germinate new Polux saplings and improve local Polux trees’ ability to consume toxic waste. While they are also immune to toxicity, they have developed a psychological requirement to consume and metabolize toxic wastepacks regularly.</description>
		<descriptionShort>Powerful advisors to rulers and despots, poluxkins are beautiful and cunning and possess an ability to connect with a polux tree, greatly enhancing its abilities. They are immune to toxicity and in fact can help the environment by consuming and metabolizing waste. They are excellent at taking care of plants and reproduce via planting a saplingchild.</descriptionShort>
