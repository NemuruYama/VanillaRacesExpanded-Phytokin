		<description>Based on genetic data retrofitted from Gauranlen Inc.â€™s investment into dendrology following the Fall of Sorne, phytokins are plant-based humanoids with an emphasis on symmetry and symbiosis. Their ability to subsist only on sunlight and affinity with any and all plantlife make them especially suited to aiding newly established colonies or underperforming industrial farms.\n\nWhile used as an attempt to subvert certain subpopulations with plant-heavy diets to favor companies that employ them, phytokin xenogerms are usually only offered to loyal employees in order to reduce the chance of their asexual reproduction blossoming out of control and earning them a voice on human rights platforms. Their affinity with plantlife, along with the side effect of extremely high psychic sensitivity, mean that any phytokin xenohumans found on the Rim are always adapted to high-concept, dominant trees that are present on their residing planet\n\nThis particular xenogerm has adapted itself to Anima trees, allowing it to converse with a local Anima tree and psychically stimulate blossoming Anima grass. They can also provide limited assistance to someone who is attempting to link with an Anima tree for psycasting benefits.</description>
		<descriptionShort>Powerful advisors to rulers and despots, animakins are beautiful and cunning and possess an ability to connect with an anima tree, greatly enhancing its abilities. They are excellent at taking care of plants and reproduce via planting a saplingchild.</descriptionShort>
